## Joke API
Clicking on the Joke button in the navbar opens a modal that features a randomly generated joke. Jokes are supplied by David Katz's **[Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api)**. Each time the modal is opened a joke category, setup and punchline is generated with JavaScript and posted on the HTML page dynamically.
